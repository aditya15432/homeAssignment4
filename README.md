Detailed explanation of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) process.

Diagram and breakdown of how the Generator and Discriminator improve through competition.

Objective functions and training logic explained clearly.

Ethical Risks in AI

Focus on Misinformation in Generative AI, such as AI-generated fake news.

Discussion of real-world implications and two actionable harm mitigation strategies: content watermarking and red teaming.

Programming Task 1: Simple GAN Implementation (MNIST)

Built and trained a simple GAN using TensorFlow to generate handwritten digits.

Implemented a Generator and Discriminator with training loop and visual outputs.

Generated sample outputs at key epochs (0, 50, 100) and plotted Generator/Discriminator loss trends.

Programming Task 2: Data Poisoning Simulation

Created a logistic regression-based sentiment classifier.

Simulated a poisoning attack by flipping sentiment labels of data related to “UC Berkeley”.

Compared classifier performance before and after poisoning using accuracy and confusion matrix visualizations.

Legal and Ethical Implications of GenAI

Explored privacy violations (e.g., GPT-2 memorizing private data) and copyright risks (e.g., generating Harry Potter text).

Provided a reasoned argument in favor of restricting AI training data under certain guidelines to ensure ethical AI development.

Fairness & Bias Evaluation with Aequitas

Used Aequitas Bias Audit Tool to examine False Negative Rate Parity.

Explained its significance and how bias can arise from data imbalance or model thresholds
